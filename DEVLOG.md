I guess I can put my notes in here
### Hello World

Ok,
Next let's set a new position for each piece of text in sections[4]
Then, we will interpolate to that position on spacebar press.

Ok I have to cut the grass now,
but it looks like I have the word counter working correctly.
So assuming the word counter is running on the same logic as the word drawer function,
then the function will be drawing each word individually.


## Remember, phaseAmt is not the thing that is directly changing the positions.
phaseAmt is how much mix there is between the origin position and the secondary position.

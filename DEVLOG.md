I guess I can put my notes in here
### Hello World


And then perhaps the decay time can be dynamically affected by
the distance away from the inner rect while still in the outer rect.
 
I have some notes on what to do next on line 57
in Section.kt

Ok, this idea doesn't seem to be working 
ie abandonedDynamicDecay-01
so I will be moving forward with two states,
trigger on, and trigger off,
and abandon the idea that there is a gradient trigger off.


## Remember, phaseAmt is not the thing that is directly changing the positions.
phaseAmt is how much mix there is between the origin position and the secondary position.

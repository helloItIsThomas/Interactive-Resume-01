I guess I can put my notes in here
### Hello World


What if I this.tracker.on() when the mouse enters a given section,
and then this.tracker.off() when the mouse leaves the section?
And then perhaps the decay time can be dynamically affected by
the distance away from the inner rect while still in the outer rect.


## Remember, phaseAmt is not the thing that is directly changing the positions.
phaseAmt is how much mix there is between the origin position and the secondary position.
